						<h3>&rtrif; FAQ</h3>
						<p id="description">
						<strong>What's the cost of an online course?</strong><br>
						All online courses are offered for free.</p>

						<p id="description">
						<strong>Are there any requirements?</strong><br>
						You will need access to a computer and YouTube. A recent Windows, Mac OS or Linux based machine will work fine.</p>

						<p id="description">
						<strong>What do I receive in completeing a course?</strong><br>
						You will get a certificate of completion from MongoDB, Inc.</p>

						<p id="description">
						<strong>Do I need to be available during a certain hour of the day to watch course videos?</strong><br>
						No. Each course is composed of pre-recorded lesson videos you may watch at any time during the run of the course. There are weekly deadlines for assignments.</p>

						<p id="description">
						<strong>How does the grading work?</strong><br>
						You will receive a final grade but the grade won't be on your certificate of completion. To receive a certificate of completion, you will need to achieve 65% on graded material. There are three different types of assessments within the course: quizzes, weekly assignments and a final exam/project. Quizzes don't count toward your grade. Quizzes are intended to help you check your own understanding. The weekly assignments will comprise one half of your grade and the final exam/project one half of your grade. Most assignments will be due on Tuesdays. Each week we will release new video lectures and a new assignments. Unfortunately, due to the large number of students and in the interest of fairness, late assignments cannot be accepted.</p>
